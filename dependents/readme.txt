the java program requires four dependents:

igeo		(http://igeo.jp/)			for 3md file import and export
processing	(https://processing.org/)		for visualization and json file writing
jts		(https://github.com/locationtech/jts)	topological calculation of polygons
gurobi		(http://www.gurobi.com/)		IP solver

the first three are attached for convenience purpose, but still it is recommended to have their latest version from offical release.
the last should be accessed via official webpage
